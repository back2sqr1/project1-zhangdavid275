            <p>Apart from living online all the time, David is a large influence within the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/singingcadets/?hl=en">Texas A&M Singing Cadets</a>, a men’s choir at Texas A&M of which he is extremely proud to be a part of. Singing at many university wide events from donation ceremonies to country music stars like George Strait, it surprises him to this day that he was able to find such a great group to engage in the arts in. He was last year’s social chairman, and this year helps the organization through event planning, often called “flower boy” due to his connections with florists in the Houston area.</p>
            <p>He is also a member of the DAIR Laboratory under <a href="https://cse-robotics.engr.tamu.edu/dshell/">Dr. Dylan Shell</a>, officer of the <a href="https://tamuacpc.org/home">Aggie Competitive Programming Club</a> and <a href="https://tidaltamu.com/">Tidal TAMU</a>, member of the <a href="https://www.cpc-nyc.org/">Chinese Planning Council</a> in NYC, and a big fan of graphic design, skateboarding, and basketball.</p>
